# Intelligent Resource Management

This action features intelligent, adaptive disk space management that optimizes performance while ensuring reliability.

## Smart Cleanup Strategy

- **Adaptive Cleanup**: Automatically detects available space and adjusts cleanup intensity (light vs aggressive)
- **Targeted Package Removal**: Intelligently identifies and removes only installed large packages (browsers, databases, SDKs)
- **Efficient Directory Scanning**: Scans for and reports actual sizes before removing large directories
- **Performance Timing**: Tracks and reports cleanup duration for optimization insights

## Advanced Storage Management

- **Smart Storage Relocation**: Configures Docker and containerd to use the larger `/mnt` partition
- **Deep Container Cleanup**: Thoroughly cleans all Docker/containerd artifacts, images, and storage layers
- **Early Validation**: Validates minimum disk space requirements (8GB) with clear error reporting
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides detailed disk usage, memory, and system state reporting

## Performance Features

- **Skip Unnecessary Work**: Avoids aggressive cleanup when sufficient space is already available (>20GB)
- **Detailed Progress Reporting**: Shows exactly what's being cleaned and how much space is recovered
- **Cross-Architecture Support**: Optimized for both x86_64 and ARM64 GitHub Actions runners (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04)
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Uses only built-in bash arithmetic (no `bc` or other external tools)
