# quick-k8s
Github Action that will automatically create a Kubernetes cluster that lives and runs on Github Actions to allow for deployment and testing of code.

## Requirements:

Linux (ARM and x86) Runners and MacOS-13 runners are supported.  See [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-docker-on-macos#arm64-processors-m1-m2-m3-series-used-on-macos-14-images-are-unsupported) for more information about when other Mac runners will be available.

## Usage:

Basic Usage:
```
steps:
  - name: Set up Quick-K8s
    uses: palmsoftware/quick-k8s@v0.0.29
```

This will create you a default 1 worker and 1 control-plane cluster with calico CNI installed.  For additional feature enablement, please refer to the flags below:

With Flags (default values shown):

```
steps:
  - name: Set up Quick-K8s
    uses: palmsoftware/quick-k8s@v0.0.29
    with:
      apiServerPort: 6443
      apiServerAddress: 0.0.0.0
      disableDefaultCni: true
      ipFamily: dual
      defaultNodeImage: 'kindest/node:v1.33.1@sha256:050072256b9a903bd914c0b2866828150cb229cea0efe5892e2b644d5dd3b34f'

      numControlPlaneNodes: 1
      numWorkerNodes: 1

      removeControlPlaneTaint: false
```

## Intelligent Resource Management

This action features intelligent, adaptive disk space management that optimizes performance while ensuring reliability:

### ðŸ§  **Smart Cleanup Strategy**
- **Adaptive Cleanup**: Automatically detects available space and adjusts cleanup intensity (light vs aggressive)
- **Targeted Package Removal**: Intelligently identifies and removes only installed large packages (browsers, databases, SDKs)
- **Efficient Directory Scanning**: Scans for and reports actual sizes before removing large directories
- **Performance Timing**: Tracks and reports cleanup duration for optimization insights

### ðŸ”§ **Advanced Storage Management**
- **Smart Storage Relocation**: Configures Docker and containerd to use the larger `/mnt` partition
- **Deep Container Cleanup**: Thoroughly cleans all Docker/containerd artifacts, images, and storage layers
- **Early Validation**: Validates minimum disk space requirements (8GB) with clear error reporting
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides detailed disk usage, memory, and system state reporting

### ðŸŽ¯ **Performance Features**
- **Skip Unnecessary Work**: Avoids aggressive cleanup when sufficient space is already available (>20GB)
- **Detailed Progress Reporting**: Shows exactly what's being cleaned and how much space is recovered
- **Cross-Architecture Support**: Optimized for both x86_64 and ARM64 GitHub Actions runners (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04)
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Uses only built-in bash arithmetic (no `bc` or other external tools)

## History

The proof-of-concept is built upon [KinD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) and was tuned as part of [certsuite-sample-workload](https://github.com/redhat-best-practices-for-k8s/certsuite-sample-workload).

This action is essentially a wrapper around some tried and true best practices for deploying a Kubernetes environment that runs well on Github Actions free-tier Ubuntu runner.
